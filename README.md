# Credit Card Default Prediction – ML Assignment 2

**Problem Statement**

The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate multiple machine learning classification models to predict whether a credit card client will default on payment in the next month.

Credit default prediction is a critical financial risk management problem. By accurately identifying high-risk customers, financial institutions can:
* Reduce potential credit losses
* Improve loan approval decisions
* Optimize credit risk strategies
* Strengthen financial portfolio stability

This is a binary classification problem, where:
* **0** → No Default
* **1** → Default

The project compares six different machine learning models and deploys them using a Streamlit web application.

**Dataset Description**

* **Dataset:** Credit Card Default Dataset
* **Total Records:** 30,000
* **Features:** 23 input features + 1 target column

🔹 **Feature Categories**

The dataset contains financial, demographic, and repayment history information.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **LIMIT_BAL** | Credit limit amount |
| **SEX** | Gender (1 = Male, 2 = Female) |
| **EDUCATION** | Education level |
| **MARRIAGE** | Marital status |
| **AGE** | Age of the client |
| **PAY_0 to PAY_6** | Repayment status for previous months |
| **BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6** | Bill amount for last 6 months |
| **PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6** | Amount paid in last 6 months |

**Target Variable**

| Value | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | No Default |
| 1 | Default |

**Models Implemented**

Six machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
5. Random Forest
6. XGBoost

**Model Evaluation Results**

Based on the final trained models:

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | MCC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9234 | 0.9643 | 0.9453 | 0.9641 | 0.9546 | 0.7115 |
| Decision Tree | 0.9950 | 0.9889 | 0.9960 | 0.9980 | 0.9970 | 0.9818 |
| KNN | 0.8793 | 0.8726 | 0.8965 | 0.9671 | 0.9305 | 0.4986 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.9309 | 0.9859 | 0.9440 | 0.9751 | 0.9593 | 0.7353 |
| Random Forest | 0.9908 | 0.9996 | 0.9911 | 0.9980 | 0.9945 | 0.9665 |
| XGBoost | 0.9975 | 1.0000 | 0.9980 | 0.9990 | 0.9985 | 0.9909 |
